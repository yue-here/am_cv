# Segmentation and particle tracking for metal AM X-ray imaging

This notebook demonstrates the use of scikit-image and trackpy to analyse high speed X-ray videos of metal additive manufacturing (laser sintering of metal powders) from the SSRL@SLAC.

The notebook "segment and plot regions - AM.ipynb" provides examples of how to use image segmentation to detect void formation during heating and how to use trackpy to the track the trajectory of these voids as they move. The example data 'laser.mp4' comes from a previously published paper from the SSRL.

A colab notebook can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bANsIUosdcJatm1_vtJf4iL-EBLi84lR/view?usp=sharing) however it not fully up to date (missing trajectory labeling).
